# SampleCatalog

I have modified the sample catalog input file to replace comma that resides in the text with semicolon, since I do not have a way to separate them from the field delimiter which is also a comma.

The input file path is hard coded as C:\\Users\\wangandshi\\eclipse-workspace\\SampleCatalog\\src\\com\\jwang\\catalog.csv. This path needs to be changed before running the code.
